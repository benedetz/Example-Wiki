# Example Wiki
This is an example of a GitHub wiki for the CS Capstone project. Add the must have wiki pages and 2 of the bonus pages below.

***Must-have wiki pages (if applicable to your project)***

**Project Overview & Goals**

A one-page summary of the problem, who benefits, and what “success” looks like (a short demo checklist works well). This anchors the team and gives graders a clear lens for evaluation.

**Requirements & Scope**

Your key project requirements in condensed form. Include any important user stories, features or detailed specifications, metrics (e.g., responsiveness, reliability, projected number of users), project risks, plus links to important resources (Requirements Doc). Keeps the project feasible and ties testing back to intent.

**System Design (with diagrams)**

The big picture: main parts, how they talk, data flow, key assumptions, and links to important resources (Design Doc). Builds a shared mental model so teammates and reviewers can follow your design.

**Key Feature Designs (optional)**

As new features are added, record the specific design changes that were necessary to add the feature. Useful for testing, release notes, etc.

**Developer Setup & Project Conventions**

Step-by-step: how to get the code, set it up, run it, and where things live in the repo. Reduces setup time for new contributors and TAs and avoids “works on my machine.”

**Testing Plan & How to Run Tests**

What you test (unit, integration, manual checks), test data, and how to run everything. Makes quality visible and repeatable, and turns requirements into checks.

**Decision Log (short design notes)**

Small entries with: the question, options, the choice, and why (date + owner). Prevents re-hashing old debates and shows your reasoning to graders.

**Data, Security, and Ethics**

What data you collect, how you protect it, and any ethical risks or mitigations. Demonstrates responsible engineering, even for student projects.

**Release Plan & Notes (milestones/demos)**
For each milestone: what’s new, how to try it, and known issues. Helps you plan demos, communicate change, and track progress over the term.

**Handoff, Reflection, and Future Work**
Limits of the current build, “if we had two more weeks,” and tips for the next team. Shows thoughtful reflection and sets up continuity.


**Add 2 of these bonus pages**
